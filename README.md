<b><i>In <a href="https://github.com/JalalDlimi/Data-Analysis-Projects">this repo</a>, you'll find tutorials of a variety of data analysis projects on real world datasets that you need to perform in order to build ML models! I will be explaining every step and what results mean during my work! Enjoy learning !</i></b>

                                  You can find the datasets I used in this repo or online ! 


#### <a href="https://github.com/JalalDlimi/Data-Analysis-Projects/tree/master/Stanford%20Open%20Policing%20Project"> 1st Project</a>: Rhode Island dataset from the <a href="https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/">Stanford Open Policing Project</a>

* <a href="https://github.com/JalalDlimi/Data-Analysis-Projects/blob/master/Stanford%20Open%20Policing%20Project/sopp.csv">'sopp.csv'</a> is the Rhode Island dataset from the [Stanford Open Policing Project](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/), made available under the [Open Data Commons Attribution License](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/by/summary/)


#### <a href="https://github.com/JalalDlimi/Data-Analysis-Projects/tree/master/Socioeconomic%20Indicators%20in%20Chicago"> 2nd Project</a>: Socioeconomic Indicators in Chicago<a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Census-Data-Selected-socioeconomic-indicators-in-C/kn9c-c2s2/"> (Dataset Here)</a>
* The city of Chicago released a dataset of socioeconomic data to the Chicago City Portal. It contains a selection of six socioeconomic indicators of public health significance and a “hardship index,” for each Chicago community area, for the years 2008 – 2012.


#### <a href="https://github.com/JalalDlimi/Data-Analysis-Projects/tree/master/Customer%20Segmentation%20using%20K-means"> 3rd Project</a>: Customer Segmentation with K-Means <a href="https://github.com/JalalDlimi/Data-Analysis-Projects/blob/master/Customer%20Segmentation%20using%20K-means/Customer_Segmentation.csv">(Dataset Here)</a>
* Despite the simplicity of K-means, it is vastly used for clustering in many data science applications, especially useful if we need to quickly discover insights from unlabeled data. In this notebook, I'll be using K-means for customer segmentation.
